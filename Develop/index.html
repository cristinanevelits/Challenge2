        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>I was raised in Romania and moved to the United States as an international student in 2019 in order to pursue my dream of becoming an artist in the technology field, as these two worlds collide for me.
            I am currently working on my B.A. in Art and Art History with a minor in Media Arts and Culture at Occidental College. I have a degree from the University of California Berkeley Extension in Coding. 
            I am extremely passionate about technology and science, coding, cyber security and art (in general) as well as any problem mathematics can solve.
            You’ll often find me up at 4am working on challenging coding tasks as I get very driven by my passion… (or just playing Minesweeper and Sudoku).
            I am looking forward to advancing my career in these fields and exploring the various sides of them, as well as opportunities to grow and learn.
