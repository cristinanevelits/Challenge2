# Challenge2
Challenge 2, Week 2, Berkeley Bootcamp.

## Project Description:

This challenge I created a portfolio for myself, that I am intending to use after graduating the BootCamp when applying to jobs. I made this project as aesthetically pleasing as possible to me, using minimalist dark design with vibrant accents of color for style and suggestion. 

- Added a title that is concise and descriptive (Portfolio)
- Created the basic html file where I just made a structure of dev name, position, recent photo, navigation bar that takes you to sections, about section, work section with application (1-5) boxes & a contact information section with my email, instagram and phone number.
- Made the first application wider and bigger as requested and now I also added my first major Project of the BootCamp to replace the placeholder image.
- Added placeholder images to the projects that simply state "Coming Soon..."
- Made sure that little details are touched upon such as the pointer becoming a clicker when hovering above href's, the underline decoration changing color, the application box border becoming more opaque when hovering, everything is responsive to different screen sizes and still looks fine etc.
